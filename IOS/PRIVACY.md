1. **No Data Collection**  
   - I do **not** collect, store, or share any personal or usage data.  
   - All cryptographic operations happen solely on your device.

2. **No Tracking & No Ads**  
   - I do not use analytics, cookies, or tracking technologies.  
   - There are no advertisements, third-party SDKs, or external calls.

3. **Copying Output**  
   - After encryption you’ll be asked **“Copy to Clipboard?”**  
     - **Allow** → copies automatically.  
     - **Cancel** → you may select and copy manually from the output box.  

4. **Free & Open Source**  
   - This app is completely free now; a paid version may be offered later, but I will never collect data or show ads.  
   - The full source code is publicly available for transparency and contributions.
